Predictive Analytics for Enhanced User Retention at Waze

In the ever-evolving landscape of navigation technology, Waze stands as a pioneer, revolutionizing the way people navigate and commute. Our commitment to providing a seamless and enriching experience for users is unwavering, fueled by a vibrant community and a dedication to innovation.

As we continue our journey of empowering drivers worldwide, we encounter the challenge of user churn â€“ the departure of users who uninstall or discontinue using the Waze app. Understanding the critical importance of user retention in sustaining growth, we embark on a mission to harness the power of predictive analytics.


**Problem Statement: 1. Develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn**
